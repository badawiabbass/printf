*This Alx Software Engineering Printf Team Project*

This a printf team project in Alx Software Engineering course and we made a printf function for the C programming language called _printf.
optimised to take different inputs and optional arguments based on how the (SLF) standard library function of printf works. We have submitted this as an ALX software engineering course requirement.

*Summary*

The printf function in C is used for formatted output. It’s part of the Standard Input/Output Library (stdio.h) and is responsible for printing data to the standard output (typically the console) in a specified format. It’s an essential tool for displaying information to users and debugging programs.
